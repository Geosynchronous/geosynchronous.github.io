Note: This folder contains the my old Splash Page that I created with Github Automatic Page Generator.  It is being replaced by a new Material Design page that I manually load.


###This is my main splash page for my Github site.
by George Fischer

TODO:  Make Original Splash page with Flat design, include links to repository for each project on it, and include contact and linked=in info in Readme

The main purpose is to make an easily navigable web page.
Examples of work can be clicked on, to run in browser, which elimanates the need to load all the files locally just to see the code run.

The code for this page was built with a feature of github that can be accessed in SETTINGS.

TODO --- Improve page with custom HTML, CSS files etc...
