##Change Splash Page Layout
**Intro**
- Now that I have finished the course, I want to create a better UI presence for my splash page.  Currently the present page was created with the automatic page generator from Github.  It looks like this:

- The old files are copied into `OldSplashPage` folder

**The Change**
- The Splash Page is being created in the `SplashPage` folder
- Will implement a Material Design Layout with more links included, and better graphics
- I also consider a Flat Design, but after reviewing the following links I decide to go with Material Desigh:
