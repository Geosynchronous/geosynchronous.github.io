##New Splash Page
This page Demos my Udacity Projects, all of which reside in my github repository.  The splash page makes available live DEMOS, INFO, and CODE links about each project.  My Skills, Bio, and Connect contacts are all referenced on this page as well. The site is responsive to desktop, tablet and phone platforms.

Materialize Framework Template was used to start the principal layout design features, that evolved into well populated site, that was optimized into MVVM design.


##Change Splash Page Layout
**Intro**
- Now that I have finished the course, I want to create a better UI presence for my splash page.  Currently the present page was created with the automatic page generator from Github.  It looks like this:

- The old files are copied into `OldSplashPage` folder

**The Change**
- The Splash Page is being created in the `SplashPage` folder
- Will implement a Material Design Layout with more links included, and better graphics
- I also consider a Flat Design, but after reviewing the following links I decide to go with Material Desigh:
