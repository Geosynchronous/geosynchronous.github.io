###This is my main splash page for my Github site.
by George Fischer  
Purpose is to make an easily navigable web page.
Examples of work can be clicked on, to run in browser, which elimanates the need to load all the files locally just to see the code run.
The code for this page was built with a feature of github that can be accessed in SETTINGS.
